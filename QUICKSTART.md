## Troubleshooting

**Port 3000 already in use?**

# Vite will automatically try port 3001, 3002, etc.
# Or specify a custom port in vite.config.js
```

**Dependencies not installing?**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Application not loading?**
```bash
# Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
node --version

# Update if needed, then reinstall
npm install
```
